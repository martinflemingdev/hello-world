# hello-world
Hi! My name is Martin, and I've always loved building things from scratch and figuring out how they work. In my youth I built crude instruments, then began taking apart small motors and soldering radios. As a video editor, I built computers and collaborated with other professionals to assemble projects ranging from corporate training videos to shooting and editing a documentary in Jamaica about Earl "Chinna" Smith, one of the original guitarists for Bob Marley.

More recently as a carpenter and CnC machine operator, I encountered Xilog, a basic programming system, and I was instantly intrigued. I've always been motivated by learning new skills and getting things done, with an unrelenting eye for detail. I'm excited to graduate from Tech Elevator and bring my passion for building and learning to a software development team!
